Guide to change the url of your starpage page.

FOR MOZILLA:

	Type 'about:preferences' in your url bar and hit enter
	Change the value of 'Home Page' to the file path of your startpage

		TIP:
		If you don't know what the file path of your startpage you can just drag
		the html file to your browser's url bar to get it. Then copy and past it into
		the Home Page value.

FOR CHORME:

    Below "Show Home button," click Change to choose your homepage.
